Regor is a binary star system containing a Blue supergiant and Wolf-Rayet star. The orbit period of this binary star system is 78.53 days. The simulation of orbit of this system have been done with Leap-Frog method. During this simulation Gamma 1 Velorum also have been considered. However, the effect of this binary system for one orbit period is negligible. 
The simulation of Stellar Intensity Interferometry (SII) also have been done for this sytem. To estimate the parameter of this system Dynesty have been used.
